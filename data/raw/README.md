# WESAD dataset

WESAD (Wearable Stress and Affect Detection) is a public multimodal dataset of 15 subjects
recorded with a chest (RespiBAN) and wrist (Empatica E4) device across baseline, stress,
amusement, and meditation conditions. It is not redistributed with this repository.

Chest and wrist are two separate devices sampled at different rates; see PROVENANCE.md for the exact
channel list and sampling frequencies used by the pipeline.

**Two distinct datasets, two distinct roles.** WESAD is the **primary** dataset for the
Leave-One-Subject-Out benchmark and every headline result. The **PhysioNet Non-EEG** dataset
(Birjandtalab et al.) is used **only** for the cross-dataset transfer experiment
(`scripts/cross_dataset.py`); it is a separate corpus (read via `wfdb`, whereas WESAD ships as `.pkl`).

Reference: Schmidt et al., "Introducing WESAD, a Multimodal Dataset for Wearable Stress and
Affect Detection," ICMI 2018.

## Download

WESAD (the primary dataset, needed for `make experiment`/`make reproduce`) is behind a one-time
research agreement; the cross-dataset PhysioNet Non-EEG set downloads directly.

```bash
make wesad   # WESAD (~2 GB) -> data/raw/WESAD          (primary; required for reproduce)
make data    # PhysioNet Non-EEG -> data/external/noneeg (cross-dataset transfer only)
```

Prefer to fetch WESAD manually? Request it from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/465/wesad+wearable+stress+and+affect+detection),
agree to the research-only terms, and extract it here:

```bash
cd data/raw
unzip WESAD.zip   # produces WESAD/S2 ... WESAD/S17
```

No download at all? make demo runs the full calibration pipeline on synthetic data.

## Expected layout

```
data/raw/WESAD/
  S2/
    S2.pkl          # signals and labels
    S2_readme.txt
    S2_quest.csv
  S3/
  ...
  S17/
```

Subjects are S2 to S17; S1 and S12 do not exist in the dataset.

## Data format

Each S*.pkl is a pickle (load with encoding="latin1") containing:

- signal.chest at 700 Hz: ACC, ECG, EMG, EDA, Temp, Resp
- signal.wrist: ACC (32 Hz), BVP (64 Hz), EDA (4 Hz), TEMP (4 Hz)
- label at 700 Hz

> Security: unpickling runs arbitrary code. Only load .pkl files you downloaded from the official
> WESAD source or generated yourself, never a .pkl from an untrusted third party.

## Verify integrity

WESAD ships no official checksum, so the SHA-256 values below are computed from the official
Uni-Siegen distribution as a reference. After extracting, verify your copy, save this block as
`data/raw/WESAD/SHA256SUMS` and run `cd data/raw/WESAD && shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS` (a mismatch
means re-download from the official source):

## Label encoding

| Label | Condition  | Used for                  |
| ----- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| 1     | Baseline   | binary, three-class       |
| 2     | Stress     | binary, three-class       |
| 3     | Amusement  | three-class               |
| 4     | Meditation | excluded                  |
| 0, 5 to 7| Other      | excluded                  |

src/data/loader.py reads this format directly; make reproduce then builds the feature
matrix and runs the benchmark.
